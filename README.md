1.2 Introduction 
We are spending our life very competitively today. But technology has revolutionized the life of human beings and has made lives easier by the various kinds of technics. As the students we concerned about this. In this situation we gave our attention about web site. A web site is a software system that is design to search for information on the World Wide Web. So, our aim is to create a web site for the zonal education office (Viyaluwa) as our project.  
When we are educating time is very important. Nowadays if zonal director wants to send a message to schools such as teacher training they happen to send letters by post. It gets two or more days to receive. Because of that efficiency is flow.  So, offices generate different types of reports according to the details of the zone. Lots of time they gather the information from files. They spend approximately one or two weeks to achieve their task.          
Zonal education office domain system is a project which aims in developing a website to publish important details of the zonal education office. Our idea is to reduce wastage and increase the efficiency of the zonal education office. This project has some features. It has a facility of admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole system. The main persons in the office can login to the web site and they generate reports. It has a facility of school login through which school can send them complains. So, anyone can view the main details of the website without login.
